A deep generative neural network based approach to impute drug response

--main
Code train VAE

--DATA
Data required to run all codes, including the downloaded data for CCLE, GDSC, and TCGA

--Figure
Code to reproduce all figures

--result
VAE results folder

--result.EN
VAEN results for CCLE (dr.CCLE) and GDSC (dr.GDSC). These are the imputed drug response for CCLE (cell lines), GDSC (cell lines), and TCGA (cancer samples).

--code
Other supporting code
01.01.CCLE.EN_GLM + nested_EN: for train VAEN
unfactor: for produce figures

--notebook
run code in kaggle
